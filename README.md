(the Bank_Churn_Messy.xslx file is included for those completing the Bank Customer Data Prep guided project)

Recommended Analysis


This project was done using structured query language (SQL) for analysis and Power BI for data visualization.Bank customer churn occurs when customers close their accounts or discontinue utilizing services of a particular bank.

In this project, I performed an analysis on the Bank's customer churn data to find out the loss of customers based on age group, country, tenure, estimated salary, balance,  credit score and number of products.

PROJECT GOALS:

What attributes are more common among churners than non-churners? 

Is there a difference between German, French, and Spanish customers in terms of account behavior?

What do the overall demographics of the bank's customers look like?

What types of segments exist within the bank's customers?

DATA CLEANING:

The data was loaded into Mysql workbench where empty rows were checked, and the find and replace tool used to rename the outcome column from binary value 0 and 1 to non-diabetic and diabetic respectively.

DATA ANALYSIS:

The data set was then imported into sequel (SQL) for analysis.

DATA VISUALIZATION: The data was visualized with Power BI.
